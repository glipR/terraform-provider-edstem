# Notes on Slides for creation

Ultimately the slide types are so varied they need to be their own resource types.

They also hit the API differently. Probably just want to add some helper functions to fit the common api request format.

## Generic tooling

* Markdown to documenttype conversion
* POST/PUT to slides endpoint
* Websocket communication for code challenges (scaffold, solution, etc)
* POST/PUT to questions endpoint for quizzes.
